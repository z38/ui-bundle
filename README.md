This bundle provides various helpers to ease development of multi-bundle applications. All helpers are modular and can be enabled separately.


## Installation

Install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

    $ composer require z38/ui-bundle

Then register the bundle in the `AppKernel.php` file:

```php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Z38\Bundle\UiBundle(),
        // ...
    );

    return $bundles;
}
```


## Features

### Placeholders

In order to improve layouts and make them more flexible a new twig token `placeholder` is implemented. It allows us to combine several blocks (templates or actions) and output them in different places in twig templates.
